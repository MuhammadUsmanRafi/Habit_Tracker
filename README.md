# Habit_Tracker
 Habit Tracker is a Python script that enables users to track and visualize their daily habits using the Pixela API. With Habit Tracker, users can create a new user account on Pixela, create a new graph, and track the progress of their habits by creating, updating, and deleting data points (called pixels) on the graph.  Habit Tracker is a flexible and customizable tool that allows users to track any habit they desire, including exercise, diet, sleep, and work-related activities. The script is written in Python and uses the requests library for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.  Habit Tracker is designed with developers in mind and contains detailed comments explaining how to use each function. The script can be easily modified to fit individual needs, and provides a starting point for developers who want to build their own habit tracking applications using the Pixela API.  Whether you're a developer or a non-technical user, Habit Tracker is an effective and professional tool that can help you stay on track with your daily habits and achieve your goals.
